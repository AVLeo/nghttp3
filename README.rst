nghttp3
=======

nghttp3 is an implementation of HTTP/3 mapping over QUIC and QPACK
in C.

It does not depend on any particular QUIC transport implementation.

HTTP/3
------

This library implements HTTP/3 draft-19.  It can exchange basic HTTP
request and response, but does not fully implement the specification
at the moment.

QPACK
-----

This library implements QPACK draft-06.
